# Airline-Delay-Python-Project

Key Questions:
-	Are different regions/states more or less likely to have delays?
-	If so, which airline is the worst offender?
-	Which airlines have the most or least number of delays?
-	What day of the week has the most or least number of delays?
-	Does the length of a flight have any connection to the rate of delays?
-	Does the type of aircraft have any effect on delays

Tasks:
Exercise 6.2: Exploring Relationships
- Conduct exploratory visual analysis using relevant Python libraries.
- Use the questions you defined in the previous task to guide your exploration.
- If possible, define hypotheses to test.

Exercise 6.3: Geographical Visualizations with Python
- Source a shapefile containing location data that corresponds to the location data in your
main project data set.
- Wrangle, clean, and merge data files in preparation for analysis.
- Conduct a geospatial analysis by creating a choropleth map using relevant Python
libraries.

Exercise 6.4: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression
- State your hypothesis.
- Select the relevant variables.
- Prepare your data for a regression analysis.
- Split the data into two sets: a training set and a test set.
-Run a linear regression on the data and analyze the model performance statistics.

Exercise 6.5: Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering
- Prepare your data for a cluster analysis.
- Use the elbow technique to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Run the k-means algorithm.
- Attach a new column to your dataframe with the resulting clusters.
- Create a variety of different visualizations using your clustered data.
- Calculate the descriptive statistics for your clusters using the groupby() function and
discuss your findings and any proposed next steps.

Exercise 6.6: Sourcing & Analyzing Time Series Data
- Source time-series data relevant to your project data via an API.
- Subset your data if necessary so that it contains only relevant historical data.
- Visualize the data in a line plot and decompose its structure.
- Conduct a Dickey-Fuller test and plot autocorrelations to test for stationarity.
- Perform differencing to stationarize non-stationary data.

Exercise 6.7: Creating Data Dashboards
- Define the use-case for your dashboard.
- Outline dashboard contents based on curated results of analysis.
- Create dashboard/storyboard in Tableau per the requirements in the project brief.
- Publish your storyboard to Tableau Public.
- Create a portfolio-ready GitHub repository for your project per the requirements above in
the project brief.
